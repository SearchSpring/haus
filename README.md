Installing
==========

# Requirements
This project is written in go.

https://golang.org/doc/install

Don't forget to set your GOPATH and add the locations of the go bin to your PATH.  You should also ensure that your PKG_CONFIG_PATH is set for compiling purposes later on.  Something like this in your .bashrc :

```bash
export GOPATH=$HOME/code/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin:/usr/local/go/bin/
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/lib/pkgconfig
```

### Installing git2go

This project requires git2go.v22, which in turn requires libgit2.  If you want SSH support with this application, ensure you have libssh2 installed as well.  A recent version of cmake is required to build libgit2 http://www.cmake.org/download/ .  You'll need to commandline tools for cmake, if you're on OSX and you've installed the GUI, goto Tools->Install for Command Line Use.  This may throw an error about failing to create symlinks.  This is a permissions error, you can create this links by hand.

```bash
/usr/bin/
cmake -> /Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake
cmake-gui -> /Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake-gui
cmakexbuild -> /Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmakexbuild
```

#### Building libgit2 and git2go

```bash
go get -d gopkg.in/libgit2/git2go.v22
cd $GOPATH/src/gopkg.in/libgit2/git2go.v22
git submodule update --init 
make install
```

#### Installing yaml

This project also requires yaml.v2

```bash
go get gopkg.in/yaml.v2
```

#### Installing RepoTsar

```bash
go get github.com/SearchSpring/RepoTsar
``` 


Usage
=====

Edit the repotsar.yml to configure you signature and repos.

```YAML
signature:
    name: "Your Name"
    email: email@address.com

repos:
    git2go:
        url: ssh://git@github.com/libgit2/git2go.git
        path: /tmp/git2go
        branch: master

```
(Reminder: YAML format is space indented, not tab)

Running repotsar without arguments will concurrently and idempotently create paths if needed, clone repos if needed, and git pull.

### Options
```RepoTsar --repos repo1,repo2,repo3 ```

Supply a comma seperated list of defined repos from your repotsar.yml to act on.

```RepoTsar --branch BranchName ```

Will in addition create local branches in all repos being acted on.
